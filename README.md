# lut_cmim2011
Repository following Computational Methods in Mechanics course at LUT University in 2011

It will contain code snippets used during the lectures and some useful links (below).

## Course Materials
The first half of the course is based on the following book:

Linge S. and Langtangen H. P., *Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave: A Gentle Introduction to Numerical Simulations with MATLAB/Octave*. 2016.

The book is freely avaliable here: [Programming for Computations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-32452-4).

Some of the code examples in this repository are taken directly from the book above. I usually made minor changes, and verify code correctness but scripts base implementation is listed in the book.

Another great source is official MATLAB help website [MATLAB Documentation](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/). If you do not know where to start, simply go to [Getting Started](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html) and explore tutorials.
